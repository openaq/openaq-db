-- These tables take longer to create and should not change often.
-- The analyses views are used for analyses data that is not ingested as part
-- of the normal ingestion process and should be rerun if any additional analysis
-- data is added.
-- The mobile_generalized view creates a materialized view that snaps
-- mobile data to a 30 meter grid and strips time to be used for maps showing
-- location where mobile data has been. This takes a long time to create, but should be
-- recalculated periodically.
